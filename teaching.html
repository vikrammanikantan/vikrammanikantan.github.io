                        I am passionate about developing programs that increase undergraduate students success in astrophysics research. I currently focus on two aspects of this: 1. training students with <mark style="background-color: var(--highlight-dark);">fundamental skills</mark> needed to perform leading research, and 2. providing mentorship and a support structure to create <mark style="background-color: var(--highlight-dark);">sustainable success</mark> and increase retention of underrepresented groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To do this, I have taken leadership roles in several programs at the University of Arizona, including the <a href="https://timestep.arizona.edu/programs/timestep-research-apprenticeship" target="_blank">TIMESTEP Research Apprenticeship</a> program and the <a href="">Computational and Mathematical Program for incoming Arizona Science Students</a> (COMPASS). I am also interested in, and attended a workshop on, developing <a href="https://ur.arizona.edu/content/course-based-research-undergraduate-experiences-cures"> Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences</a> (CUREs) to increase undergraduate research opportunities.

                    In its first two iterations, COMPASS was a week-long workshop for incoming Arizona Science students to learn fundamental programming and computational skills needed for success in research and coursework. As a <mark>co-organizer and instructor</mark>, I developed the Python and data visualization aspect of the curriculum by designing work-along jupyter notebooks and leading several sessions on Python programming, data analysis, and visualization.

                    Significantly, I designed and gave two lectures connecting the class material to my current research on supermassive binary black holes. The <a href="files/astro300a1.pdf" target="_blank">first lecture</a> covered dynamical interactions that drive the inspiral of supermassive binary black holes: I walked them through an order-of-mag estimate of dynamical friction timescales and compared it to the gravitational wave inspiral timescale. The goal was to demonstrate how professional astrophysicists gain intuition for complicated systems. The <a href="files/astro300a2.pdf" target="_blank">second lecture</a> covered the methods I use in my current research. The goal was to demonstrate how research is performed (in one specific method) at the forefront of the field.
